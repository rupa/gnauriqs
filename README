Minimum dynamically modifiable IRC bot.

* Check dependencies, edit and run gnaurics.

* For each message from the server, any functions in funcs.py that start with
  'cmd_' will be executed, and passed a dictionary. This dictionary is
  persistent, and can be used for storage. The following keys are maintained:
  {
      'time': datetime.now(),
      'nick': NICK,
      'admins': ADMINS,
      'raw': MESSAGE,
  }
  Response from these functions should be a string or iterable containing valid
  IRC commands that will be passed to the server, or None. We do take care of
  '\r\n' termination.

* Edits to funcs.py are picked up without restarting.

* You do the rest! You do speak RFC 1459, right?
