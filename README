Minimum dynamically modifiable IRC bot.

* Edit and run gnaurics.

* For each message from the server, any functions in funcs.py that start with
  'cmd_' will be executed, and passed a dictionary:
  {
      'time': datetime.now(),
      'nick': NICK,
      'admins': ADMINS,
      'raw': MESSAGE,
  }
  Response from these functions should be a string or list containing valid
  IRC commands, or None. We do take care of '\r\n' termination.

* Edits to funcs.py are picked up without restarting.

* You do the rest! You do speak RFC 1459, right?
